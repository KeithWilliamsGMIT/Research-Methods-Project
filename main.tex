% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
The traditional release process involved a major, infrequent, monolithic release of a software product which was a source of many conflicts and errors. Continuous delivery introduced an alternative approach where releases are small, frequent and incremental, but what are the benefits and challenges of this approach? This paper collates information from a number of sources in an attempt to answer this question. The benefits of continuous delivery include increased productivity, shorter time-to-market, better communication, improved release reliability and quality and automated acceptance and unit tests while challenges include transforming towards continuous delivery, time pressure, technical debt, lower test coverage and increased quality assurance effort. If these challenges can be overcome, then continuous delivery can add value to any software project.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} term continuous delivery is a relatively new software development discipline related to releasing a software product. It is closely associated with both the Agile methodology and DevOps. The traditional approach of releasing a product would be to perform testing and bug fixing towards the end of a long development cycle, meaning the time between two subsequent releases. At this point the developers would hand the software off to the operation engineers who would be responsible for deploying it to production. Mistakes were not uncommon in this scenario due to the amount of manual work involved. DevOps is a software development practice which aims to bring together development and operations with the end goal of shortening release cycles. Continuous delivery offers an alternative to this traditional release approach. This paper will attempt to determine whether or not the payoff of adopting continuous delivery outweighs these challenges which must be overcome. However, we must start by defining the concepts of both Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).

\subsection{Continuous Integration}
When discussing continuous delivery it is necessary to also mention continuous integration as it is a precondition of continuous delivery. Fowler defines continuous integration as a "software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently" \cite{fowler2006continuous}. In other words, the software is built and tested frequently. The article goes on to outline the practices of continuous integration. A single source repository should be maintained. The build should be automated and self-testing to ensure that the system is still functional and stable after new changes. Everyone should commit to the mainline everyday where the mainline is the current state of the system. This is important as the more time between commits will increase the possibility of conflicts occurring and also the severity of those conflicts. The mainline should be built on the integration machine, also known as a CI server. The build should be fast, to ensure quick feedback loops for developers. If the build fails the developer who made the change is notified of the failure and then have the option of either fixing the error(s) which caused the failure or revert the change so that the systems returns to a functional and stable state. Tests should be carried out in a clone of the production environment to decrease the risk of any unexpected problems occurring when the application is released. Everyone should easily be able to get the latest executable. Finally, everyone can see whats happening and deployments should be automated.

\subsection{Continuous Delivery}
Continuous delivery is the discipline of ensuring that the system under development is ready to be released to production at any given time. Continuous delivery extends continuous integration and requires the release process to be automated. While continuous integration is a single stage process, continuous delivery is a multi stage process \cite{LAUKKANEN201755}.

Continuous delivery is usually achieved by creating a multi stage pipeline which the application is passed through. The continuous delivery pipeline might vary slightly between different applications. A typical pipeline might have the following stages, at a minimum. First the code is committed to a version control repository. Next is the build stage which is responsible for executing unit and integration tests, generating code coverage and also building artifacts. These build artifacts are used in all later stages of the pipeline. The final stage is the production stage where the build artifact is deployed to the production environment. Additional stages might include acceptance testing, performance testing and manual testing stages. If any errors occur at any stage in the pipeline the pipeline stops and the developers are notified.

It's also worth mentioning the term continuous deployment which is an extension on continuous delivery where there are no manual steps from the commit stage to the production stage \cite{LAUKKANEN201755}. These terms are often used interchangeably in industry. The purpose and goal of adopting continuous delivery or continuous deployment goes back to the main goal of DevOps of quick development cycles. The relationship between concepts of continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment concepts is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:relationship}.

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{relationship.png}
	\caption{Adapted from Shanin \cite{shahin2017continuous}. The relationship between continuous integration, delivery and deployment.}

\end{figure*}

\section{Benefits of Continuous Delivery}
Some proposed benefits of continuous delivery are automated acceptance and unit tests, improved communication, increased productivity and efficiency, the ability of finding problems earlier in the software development life cycle (SDLC) which reduce costs, increased customer satisfaction, shorter time-to-market, narrower testing scope and improved release reliability and quality \cite{LAUKKANEN201755}.

\subsection{Increased Productivity}
It has been found that adopting continuous delivery helps to increase developer productivity for a number of reasons. It enables a single developer to both develop and deploy an improvement to the system \cite{mantyla2015rapid}, it facilitates parallel development \cite{staahl2013experienced}, there is less compiling and testing needed locally before checking in changes and also as a direct result of the automating the deployment process \cite{RODRIGUEZ2017263}. M{\"a}ntyl{\"a} found that this increase in production led to more tests being executed per day after moving from the traditional release approach to using continuous delivery \cite{mantyla2015rapid}. This was the result of either more builds needing to be tested or the changes between builds increased which required more testing for each build. Chen estimates developers also spent 20 percent of their time configuring test environments and operations \cite{chen2015continuous}. Likewise, testers spent a considerable amount of time configuring test environments. On top of this developers and operation engineers had to spend considerable effort troubleshooting each deployment. This is all automated by the continuous delivery process.

\subsection{Shorter Time-To-Market}
Shorter release cycles are important to companies as they allow them to constantly develop, learn and improve their offers based on rapid, if not instant, feedback from their customers about new features and bug fixes \cite{RODRIGUEZ2017263}. According to Chen, by adopting continuous delivery his organisation was able to increase release frequency from once every one to six months to at least once a week on average \cite{chen2015continuous}. He goes on to state that the time between conceptualising a user story to deploying the feature to production has decreased from several months to within a week. This ultimately helps drive business value and competition.

\subsection{Better Communication}
Continuous delivery encourages communication both within teams and between teams \cite{staahl2013experienced}. For example, developers and system engineers often have communication problems and also a lack of appreciation for each others concerns due to their different backgrounds. This can cause tension between the teams. Continuous delivery, and DevOps as a whole, introduce developers to the system administrator role and vice versa. In other words, the gap between both teams is reduced, communication is improved and tensions are eased by introducing people with knowledge and experience in the administration and operations role to the developer team.

\subsection{Release Reliability and Quality}
By releasing a software product more frequently, the changes between deployments are less significant. They are usually small, incremental changes which make conflicts easier to find and eliminate. Chen states that open bugs decreased by over 90 percent \cite{chen2015continuous}. This in turn improves the quality of the system and leaves the system in a stable state for the next deployment. This also has a knock on effect significantly reduced costs by eliminating bugs early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), with some estimating by factors of 50 and 200 \cite{boehm1988understanding}.

\subsection{Automated acceptance and unit tests}
Although automated testing is a result of continuous integration, as mentioned above, continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration. Continuous integration is considered essential in supporting the agile testing practices, which involves both automated customer defined acceptance tests and unit tests that are written in conjunction with production code \cite{staahl2013experienced}. Staahl states that the acceptance tests should be run at least daily as part of a regression test suite \cite{staahl2013experienced}. A regression test suite is a set of test scenarios that are designed to ensure that software is still functional after making changes. These tests are more effective when there is a direct interaction with the customer \cite{staahl2013experienced}. The unit tests should be written for all new code added during a development cycle and should be run those with every build \cite{staahl2013experienced}. By writing and automating these tests ensure that the system is regularly verified and validated. In other words it ensures that the system works and is what the customer requires.

\section{Challenges of Continuous Delivery}
Continuous delivery does not come without its challenges which can make it unappealing to adopt. These challenges include increased technical debt, lower reliability and test coverage, lower customer satisfaction, time pressure, transforming towards continuous delivery, increased quality assurance (QA) effort and applying continuous delivery in the embedded domain.

\subsection{Transforming towards Continuous Delivery}
Adopting continuous delivery requires a change of mindset and organisational culture \cite{chen2015continuous}. For example, different teams with different goals must be able to work together. People are generally resistant to change unless there are convincing reasons for those changes \cite{shahin2017continuous}. Therefore, this kind of organisational change must come from higher management who have the ability to break down various barriers within an organisation and who can promote a collaborative culture or from heroic employees looking for a better solution to the problems of the traditional approach. Changing culture can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Shahin also outlines a number of reasons why not all developers embrace continuous delivery. They include the fear of exposing low quality code, skepticism about the added values of adopting continuous delivery as well as the potential risks of adopting continuous delivery \cite{shahin2017continuous}.

\subsection{Time Pressure}
Shanin states that building high-quality applications that must be frequently released can put both the development and operation teams under continuous time pressure and stress compared to the traditional release strategy \cite{shahin2017continuous}. This pressure has a positive effect of increased efficiency from developers who must meet tight deadlines \cite{mantyla2015rapid}. However, this comes with the possibility of team burn-out which can have a knock on effect of lower quality software being produced by the development team if not managed correctly.

\subsection{Technical Debt}
One observation of continuous delivery relating to quality assurance is the concept of technical debt. Technical debt refers to the extra development that is required after code is implemented in these short development cycles rather than applying the best overall solution from the beginning. A common example of technical debt is refactoring, which is the result of evolving software. This technical debt can result from the speed and lack of discipline in these short cycles which can cause software engineers, and testers, to cut corners in order to meet tight deadlines. In other words, there is a trade-off between the quick deployment of software and the quality of software. Therefore, any organisation applying continuous delivery must be willing to invest time outside the short development cycles to continuously monitor, measure and fix this technical debt \cite{RODRIGUEZ2017263}. However, one might argue that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to design any moderately complex system right from the beginning.

\subsection{Lower Test Coverage}
Due to the shorter release cycles, there is less time for testing. Therefore, the scope of tests, and hence the test coverage, is usually limited and focused on only the most important tests \cite{mantyla2015rapid}. M{\"a}ntyl{\"a} found that rapid releases seemed to have progressively less different test cases. He gives the example of Firefox, while Firefox 5.0, which was the first version that used the rapid release approach, had 270 unique test cases, Firefox 12 had only 100 unique test cases. To add to this, rapid releases reach 90 percent of their maximum number of unique test cases within a week, which indicates that the reduced scope of testing is determined very early during a new release cycle \cite{mantyla2015rapid}.

\subsection{Increased QA efforts}
Continuous delivery reportedly requires increased QA efforts due to the overhead involved in managing the infrastructure responsible for automated tests \cite{RODRIGUEZ2017263}. M{\"a}ntyl{\"a}'s case study of Firefox found that rapid releases significantly increased the test effort required due to the need for specialized testers to sustain the testing effort in a rapid release model \cite{mantyla2015rapid}. The need for increased QA efforts is also tied to both time pressure and technical debt, both of which can put pressure on testing efforts.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

\section{Conclusion}
As seen in this paper, the rapid release approach that continuous delivery offers has many benefits over the more traditional big bang approach of large, infrequent releases. However, it comes with a number of challenges which must be overcome before adopting continuous delivery. These changes can often be difficult and time consuming, particularly when large teams or even a number of teams are involved. However, by understanding these challenges from the outset makes them easier to predict and overcome. While the area of continuous delivery looks quite promising, it is still in its infancy. However, due to the evolving needs of customers, it seems that continuous delivery will be adopted by more and more companies, both big and small, over the next number of years with the aim of providing a better service to their customers.
